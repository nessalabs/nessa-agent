# Codebase structure

The general rules live in the **`system-architect`** skill
([structure reference](../.claude/skills/system-architect/references/structure.md)) —
layout, dependency direction, the generic absences, boundaries between runtimes,
and how to grow a module. This file is only the part that is specific to Nessa,
and it is the part that changes as Nessa grows.

## Today

Nessa is a two-runtime desktop app: a Rust host (window, tray, shortcut,
settings, OS integration) and a React shell (chat surface, composer, avatar).
The conversation vertical has earned the split: the panel is a projection, and
a server will own the commands. Other modules stay flat until they earn the
same trigger — an invariant, a second consumer, or their own persistence.

## Target shape

```
src/                      composition root (`main.tsx`, `store.ts`)
  conversation/           product vertical (model / use cases / gateway / UI)
  session/                wire session to nessa-server (@nessa/client)
  panel/                  floating-window chrome (model / adapters / UI)
  host/                   injected OS features + the window seam
src-tauri/src/
  <context>/
    domain/               rules, entities, value objects, events
    application/          use cases + ports (traits) the use case needs
    adapters/             storage, OS, IPC command handlers, clock
    contracts/            what other contexts and the frontend may see
```

The Tauri command layer is an **adapter**, not a home for logic. A
`#[tauri::command]` function should read like: deserialise, call one use case,
serialise. If it contains a decision, that decision belongs in a use case or a
domain object.

The frontend is likewise an adapter. React state models *what is on screen*; it
does not own product rules. When the shell starts encoding a rule ("a turn can
only be cancelled while streaming"), that rule has a home on the Rust side and
the shell reads the result.

Types carry meaning here as much as anywhere: a `SessionId`, not a `String`; a
`PanelWidth`, not an `f64`. The window geometry code in particular is a place
where a wrong number in the right slot compiles happily.

## The absences

The generic list is in the skill. These are the Nessa-specific ones, and they
must stay true:

1. `domain/` contains no `tauri`, `serde`-transport, async-runtime, or
   filesystem import.
2. `main.rs` is the app composition root. OS-specific hosts are injected by
   `platform::current()`; shared modules never construct a macOS or Linux host.
3. The panel frame is reapplied on every show. Nothing caches a frame across
   shows — that is the bug the design exists to prevent.
4. Every host call goes through `src/host/window.ts` and no-ops outside Tauri.
5. A settings file missing keys still launches; every new key has a default.
6. Edge failures — blur, sizing, tray, viewport — are reported and survivable,
   never fatal. The panel opening unblurred, or without a tray, beats the panel
   not opening.
7. The page's viewport does not move during a resize, on macOS or on Linux.
8. Linux is reachable without a menu bar: skip-taskbar is off, and the panel
   opens on launch.
9. On Linux the webview's grandparent is the GtkWindow. Nesting the pin
   widget inside tao's vbox panics on click (Tauri unwraps that grandparent
   as a Window) and GTK cannot unwind, so the process aborts.

## The core and what sits on it

Nessa will grow a core — the agent runtime, the turn lifecycle, the transport to
whatever produces replies — and a set of product surfaces on top of it: the
panel, the composer, the tray, whatever comes after.

- The runtime core has no knowledge that a menu bar panel exists. No `if panel`,
  no field only the tray sets, no enum variant named after a surface.
- A surface composes core pieces and adds its own rules. It depends on the core;
  the core never depends on it.
- When a surface needs something the core cannot express, the core gains a
  *general* capability — a port, an event, a parameter naming a concept the core
  already has — and the surface supplies the specific part.
- The test: could this core piece serve a Nessa with no menu bar at all — a CLI,
  a second window, a background run? If not, it has been contaminated.

The same applies inside the host today. `panel.rs` owns the frame; `tray.rs`
owns the menu. The tray does not own conversation state, and it does not decide
preferences — it requests and reflects. Keep new code pointing the same way.

On Linux the tray may not exist. That is an edge failure, not a different
architecture: the panel is still the product, the taskbar is how you reach it,
and `main.rs` is still the only place that decides to show the window because
the tray is missing.

## Rules for the host/shell seam

The one boundary that already exists, and the one most likely to rot silently.

- **One definition of every payload shape, imported by both sides.** Never
  redeclare the shape of a command argument or event on the receiving side. Two
  declarations of the same contract drift with no error anywhere — the compiler
  is happy on both sides right up until runtime. The names and `PanelSize` live
  in `host.rs` and `src/host/window.ts`; a test in `host.rs` fails if a name on
  the host is missing from the shell. Generating one side from the other is the
  next step if this list grows.
- **Every new host call goes through the existing seam and no-ops outside the
  desktop host**, or `pnpm dev` breaks quietly for whoever does design work next.
- **Pass the first payload in, do not make the shell ask for it.** State the
  shell needs to paint its first frame should arrive with the shell, not as a
  round trip after mount. Defer anything heavy that is not needed for that frame.
- **Anything per-frame is scaled by elapsed time.** Panel animation, coasting,
  easing, decay — a flat per-tick multiplier runs at double speed on a 120 Hz
  display and produces bug reports that read "feels wrong on my machine". Write
  decay as a power of elapsed time, and velocity as pixels per second.
- **Fake the clock in tests.** Anything timed gets its clock injected, including
  animation and anything that measures itself.
- **Linux is not a later port.** A change that only works behind a macOS
  `cfg` — a tray that is fatal, a size command that errors, a frost that never
  paints, a resize that jitters — is a defect, not a platform gap.

## Failure-first checklist for host code

The general questions are in the skill. What they mean here, before any new code
touching the filesystem, the OS, or another process:

- What if it runs twice — two shows, a double shortcut press, a restart
  mid-write?
- Is this failure fatal or survivable? Match the existing policy: edge failures
  degrade the surface and are logged with the `[nessa]` prefix; they do not stop
  the launch.

Settings writes are the current instance of most of this: a partial write must
not produce a file that fails to load, which is what `serde(default)` plus
writing the full defaults on first launch is buying.

## Frontend specifics

- A component either renders or coordinates, never both. Coordination lives in a
  hook; rendering takes props and has no idea where they came from.
  `src/panel/ui/app.tsx` is the chrome. Conversation UI lives in
  `src/conversation/ui/`. Host subscriptions live in `src/panel/adapters/`.
- Product commands live in `src/conversation/application/usecases/`. The store
  is a projection: reducers call `ConversationGateway` and keep the tabs.
  The shared tabs are `conversations` + `activeId`. Local id counters live on
  `LocalTabs`, not on the model the future server will share. Other modules
  import `src/conversation` (the barrel), not files under it — `store.ts` is
  the exception, so tests do not pull the design system. Host subscriptions
  stay in adapters. See
  [adr/0002-conversation-vertical-and-gateway.md](adr/done/0002-conversation-vertical-and-gateway.md).
- Design-system components are consumed, not wrapped "just in case". A wrapper
  with no behaviour is a layer that only forwards.
- Host-window interaction goes through one seam (as it already does), so the UI
  runs in a plain browser with the seam no-oping. Keep that property: it is what
  makes design work fast, and it is a real architectural boundary, not a
  convenience.
- Persisted UI preference is state with an owner. The frontend owning the
  surface choice and the tray reflecting it — rather than the tray owning it —
  is the right direction; keep new preferences pointing the same way.
- Frost is a host concern. macOS uses a native effect view; Linux and the
  browser use CSS. The shell picks via `data-host`, it does not reach for
  `backdrop-filter` on the macOS Tauri window.

## Dependency composition

Use the [typed DI foundation](design/dependency-injection.md). TypeScript constructs
one dependency scope in `main.tsx`, injects effects into Redux thunks, and shares
its session handle with the lifecycle. Rust composes `RuntimeDependencies` into
`AppState`; application-owned traits define replaceable effects. Extend these
patterns for actual backend integrations without adding a service locator.

## Agent SDK foundation

`crates/nessa-sdk` owns model metadata, immutable effective capability snapshots,
and application execution ports. `domain/model_metadata/`
groups the feature into `value_objects/`, `entities/`, and `aggregates/`. Related
value objects share identity, capabilities, and description files; the catalog
aggregate owns model uniqueness rules. `domain/common/value_objects/` supplies
shared Date and Url values backed by pure parsing libraries, plus feature-independent
TokenLimits and its validation error. `application/`
owns DTOs, explicit mappings, and import/list/select use cases. The JSON reader
adapter lives in `infrastructure/model_metadata_json.rs`. Composition chooses and opens the catalog
file, then injects the immutable result. See the [SDK guide](../crates/nessa-sdk/README.md).
`domain/effective_capabilities/value_objects/` intersects binding/model features,
validates configured limits, and checks input requirements locally. Application
DTOs project the same snapshot. `application/agent_binding/` owns execution ports,
typed observations/controls, and the capability admission use case.
`infrastructure/claude_acp/` implements the pinned local adapter, bounded protocol
worker, and restricted Unix process supervision. Host composition supplies model,
process configuration, environment, and limits. Conversation lifecycle rules,
durable command acceptance, and harness settings readers remain future work.

## Identity and access library

`crates/nessa-auth` is a workspace library with pure domain models and
application-owned DTOs/ports. See its [module and collaboration guide](../crates/nessa-auth/README.md).
The local backend, embedded Cedar, and `/session` gateway are implemented.
`nessa-server/src/product` owns the guarded wire profile; composition injects its
providers. See [local authentication](adr/done/0010-local-authentication.md). Hosted
identity providers remain future adapters.

`crates/nessa-local-storage` owns native OS private-file mechanics shared by the
local auth adapter and the desktop credential adapter. It has no auth/domain policy
or Tauri dependency; callers inject the resulting adapters through composition.
