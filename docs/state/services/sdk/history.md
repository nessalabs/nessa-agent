# Committed history and restoration

Nessa shows live output while saving conversation records in small batches. Reopening reconstructs history from the records that were successfully saved.

Text shown since the last successful save can be lost on a crash. A failed save is not advertised as committed history. Each save attempt has an identity so a retry can confirm an already-completed write without duplicating it. Reset must settle uncertain erasure before loading or saving new history.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Observed: Correlated live event
    Observed --> PendingCommit: Retain unsaved messages
    PendingCommit --> Saving: Fixed deadline or size/count boundary
    PendingCommit --> Saving: Tool, review, terminal or settlement boundary
    Saving --> Acknowledged: Exact semantic changes committed
    Saving --> Uncertain: Storage error / retain exact pending generation
    Uncertain --> Saving: Retry exact retained write / reconcile physical prefix
    Acknowledged --> PendingCommit: Later observations / next generation
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ReadTail: Reconstruct under writer lease
    ReadTail --> Fold: Complete or previously aborted facts
    ReadTail --> AbortTail: Valid incomplete physical fact
    AbortTail --> Fold: Durable exact abort acknowledged
    ReadTail --> Refused: Malformed physical framing
    Fold --> Validate: Apply committed semantic decisions
    Validate --> Prepared: Agreement valid
    Validate --> Refused: Contradictory evidence
    Prepared --> Resume: Exact provider identity and context / authorize opening
    Resume --> Attached: Verified supported restoration
    Resume --> Refused: Missing or unsupported context
```
